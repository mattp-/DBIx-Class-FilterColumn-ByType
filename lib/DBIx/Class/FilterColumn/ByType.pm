=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your Schema or DB class add "FilterColumn::ByType" to the top of the
component list.

  __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw( FilterColumn::ByType ... ));

Set up filters for the column types you want to convert.

 __PACKAGE__->filter_columns_by_type( [qw/varchar text/] => {
     filter_to_storage => 'to_utf8',
     filter_from_storage => 'from_utf8',
 });

 use Encode;
 sub to_utf8 { encode('utf8', $_[1]) }

 sub from_utf8 { decode('utf8', $_[1]) }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a subclass of L<DBIx::Class::FilterColumn>, which allows you to
attach filters by column type, as well as by column name. You should look at
L<DBIx::Class::FilterColumn> documentation for a full explanation of how
FilterColumn works.

If you'd like to do something like filter all varchars in your entire schema,
you would only need to create a base result class, then call
filter_columns_by_type from there. See t/lib/A/Schema inside the dist for an
example.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 filter_column_by_type

 __PACKAGE__->filter_columns_by_type( coltype => { ... })

 __PACKAGE__->filter_columns_by_type( [qw/coltype/] => { ... })

This method takes two arguments. The first, coltype, can be either an array of
scalars, or a scalar that describe the type(s) the filters will be attached to.
The second argument is passed straight through to FilterColumn::filter_column()
without modification.
